### Dependencies

- [GRUB Bootloader] (https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) as the bootloader for my operating system.

### Plans

As of right now the project is currently not complete. The following are features I plan on adding:
 - Multitasking
 - Paging
 - Memory Management
 - Super simple UI 
 - Include text editor/small games?
 - Write my own bootloader eventually
